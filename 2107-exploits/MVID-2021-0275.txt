Threat: Trojan.Win32.Inject.adwas
Vulnerability: Insecure Permissions 
Description: The malware creates a dir with insecure permissions under c:\ drive and grants change (C) permissions to the authenticated user group. Standard users can rename the executable dropped by the malware to disable it or replace it with their own executable. Then wait for a privileged user to logon to the infected machine to potentially escalate privileges.
