Technical Details & Description:
================================
A persistent input validation web vulnerability has been discovered in the official Perfex v2.4.4 crm web-application.
The vulnerability allows remote attackers to inject own malicious script codes with persistent attack vector to compromise browser 
to web-application requests from the application-side.

The persistent vulnerability is located in the `company` name parameter of the `./clients/client` (Customer) module.
Remote attackers with low privileges are able to inject own malicious persistent script code as company name to compromise 
the internal print function of the backend. The attacker inject his code and in case the admin or other privileged user 
account try to export via print function the code simple executes wihtin a new tab context. The request method to inject 
is POST and the attack vector is located on the application-side.

Successful exploitation of the vulnerabilities results in session hijacking, persistent phishing attacks, persistent external 
redirects to malicious source and persistent manipulation of affected application modules.
