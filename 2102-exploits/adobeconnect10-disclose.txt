### Description :

*There are many web applications in the world, each of which has
vulnerabilities due to developer errors, and this is a problem for all of
them, and even the best of them, like the "adobe connect" program, have
vulnerabilities that occur every month. They are found and fixed by the
team.
*With the disclosure of the admin username, one of the most important steps
in the field of targeted hacking can be taken, and as a result, the hacker
can more easily achieve his desire, which may be destruction or ransomware
attack or infection.

*Given the vulnerability that was released some time ago (
https://cxsecurity.com/issue/WLB-2021010128), a hacker with these two
vulnerabilities can make significant progress in his targeted hacking.

*For example, by finding the admin username, the hacker can go to the next
step of his targeted hacking only by cracking the password or other ways.
And if it encounters a problem at this stage, it can solve the problem at
this stage of the hack by knowing the previous vulnerability (
https://cxsecurity.com/issue/WLB-2021010128).
Of course, in addition to obtaining a username and password, you also need
access to the admin panel.
Protecting your username and password and hiding the admin panel is one of
the most important ways to increase security, which unfortunately is
largely the case.
I hope that by writing this research, an important step in security can be
taken.

*By adding this (/system/help/support) to the end of the desired website
address, you can view the username without any filter or obstacle.
Sometimes even without a username and password.
And by adding (/system/login) to the end of the desired website address,
you can access the admin panel without any filters.
